# LONER-LANDER
A Lunar-Lander clone with different planets and increasing difficulty.

This is my second project after coming back to coding games and I learn a lot while making it.
- learned Unity's new Input System.
- learned how to use Events to handle communication between different systems.
- learned how to use scriptableObjects to persistent data
- learned more how to make scripts that handle single responsibilities (ex: ScoreManager only handles score).
- learned simple UI.
- how to bridge Ui and game logic.
- very simple animations (for the ship).
- multiple scenes and scene management.
- multiples managers and some with persistence between scenes. 
    - it kinda weird tbh i didnt understand very well, i had a problem creating some levels without the managers and lost of reference in some components.
- learned to how make a build (have issue of false positive)
    - need to learn how to fix it, i heard something about signing but idk how to do it.
